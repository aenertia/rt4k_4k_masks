# rt4k_4k_masks
A collection of Retrotink 4k (pro) masks tested for 2160p60 outputs - mainly using honeycomb-ish like effects to provide aliasing/kerning effects for output on 4K Displays. Especially with 5th/6th gen consoles (xbox360,ps3,wiiu,gamecube,wii). Best for large displays (tested on 55,65 and 75 inch) at a seated distance of 3metres (couch play).

Note I get best results by adjusting HDR brightness in profile with most of these masks. For low-res inputs >480p you will get quite variable results from the default mesh/honeycomb profiles which are best for HD inputs. But especially for JPRG retro titles some of the chroma/gem masks can really make a huge difference to text readibility.
